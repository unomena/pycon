                    <p>PyConZA is the first annual gathering of the South African community using and developing the open-source Python programming language. PyConZA is organized by the Python community for the community and presented by Praekelt Foundation. We'd like PyConZA to be accessible to as many people as possible and to foster unique solutions to the challenges we face in Africa.</p>
                    <p>The first PyConZA will be taking place at the The Pavilion Clocktower in the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront, Cape Town, South Africa from the 4 - 5 October 2012. <a href="register.html"><strong>Register here</strong></a>.</p>
